    <h2>Interest in IT
      When and where did it start: As a child, I always had a fascination for technology to a potentially unhealthy degree. My dad was a systems administrator throughout my childhood and always built himself new pcs for work and gaming in his spare time. My natural interest became intensified when the student laptops program came to be a thing when I was in high school and I had access to a laptop I could bring home and use in my spare time. My interest was further increased when I started studying engineering and got into the programming side of things
through mechatronics and the coding class I did at UWS. So when it came time to choose to move on from Hospitality T programming was the natural choice for me. I chose RMIT because it affords me the ability to study on my own time and around a full-time work week. It allows me to be flexible during a period of time when my time is chaotic. As for my expectations, I don't really have any major expectations. I came into my studies looking to make a major change in my life and my studies are just the avenues to do so.</h2>

    <h5>Project Idea
      One issue this year is the inability of trip planners like google maps to have real-time information about road closures during floods and other events that would create road closures. The proposed application will be a dynamic trip planning application that allows the user to plan trips on the fly with real-time adaptations based on available information. The goal of this application is to make transportation, either private or public, more easily possible for areas like the Hawkesbury and flood-prone areas of Queensland for people to be able to move around during times of floods and lead to less panic in those times.

      In the past 3 years, the Hawkesbury has had to deal with flooding on 4 separate occasions that in the recent 2 floods have led to a great deal of confusion about bus timetables and delays around flooded roads, and changes to timetables on apps and websites that allow the user to plan trips. In particular, Google Maps routinely failed to update when bus trips were canceled in the area until 20 minutes after the bus is listed to arrive at a particular stop. These applications also failed to account for bus routes being diverted and for bus replacements for trains.

      The proposed project would be a website and application that would allow users to plan and save trips for regular use that update in real-time. These trip plans would, in real-time, change their routes based on information from transportation and websites like NRMA. Users would be able to see variations on travel plans, detours, road closures, traffic times, and delays to public transport on the fly and be able to change routes on the fly and minimize issues and hassles in planning travel with everything being in a particular location on the users' phone. Users will also get real-time data about their busses and locations if a bus is running late or early. When users start planning their trip, the app will use information from places like bus ways and traffic tracking websites to provide users with options from point a to point b. The app will adapt travel times based on traffic changes and provide alternative routes if users want to avoid traffic. The app will also provide up-to-date information on bus locations along routes so that users can keep track of their travel. During floods, it will provide up-to-date information for users on what bus routes will remain running and roads that are closed for drivers to avoid flooded areas better.</h5>
