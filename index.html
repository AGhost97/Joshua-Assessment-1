      <head>Interest in IT</head>
      When and where did it start: As a child, I always had a fascination for technology to a potentially unhealthy degree. My dad was a systems administrator throughout my childhood and always built himself new pcs for work and gaming in his spare time. My natural interest became intensified when the student laptops program came to be a thing when I was in high school and I had access to a laptop I could bring home and use in my spare time. My interest was further increased when I started studying engineering and got into the programming side of things
through mechatronics and the coding class I did at UWS. So when it came time to choose to move on from Hospitality T programming was the natural choice for me. I chose RMIT because it affords me the ability to study on my own time and around a full-time work week. It allows me to be flexible during a period of time when my time is chaotic. As for my expectations, I don't really have any major expectations. I came into my studies looking to make a major change in my life and my studies are just the avenues to do so.
